## Project Abstract
This project aims to analyze crime data to determine whether there are significant correlations between crime rates and two variables: gender and season. This project aims to understand these relationships in order to provide insights that could potentially inform public safety strategies regarding crime. My research questions are: does gender influence crime rates, does the season affect crime rates, and which variable, gender or season, has a greater impact on crime rates?
